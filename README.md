# Layout
## Scaffold
`Scaffold` provides a basic structure for laying out widgets in a way you would expect on macOS. You must specify a `body` as the main content area, and you can optionally provide a `sidebar` that will show to the left of `body`. The `sidebar` can be resized by grabbing the split and dragging left or right. See the documentation for all customization options.
