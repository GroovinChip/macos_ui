# Contributing to macos_ui

Thanks for checking out `macos_ui`! We appreciate your interest in contributing! Here are some 
basic things you'll need to know to get started.

### Branch structure

The default branch for this project is `dev`. Your work should take place in a branch checked out
from here. `stable` is reserved for releases to pub.dev. All pull requests should therefore
target `dev`.

`dev` and `stable` are protected branches.

Pull requests should **always** be merged via GitHub and not via command-line.

### Commit style
This repository uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Please ensure that you use them!

### Versioning

`macos_ui` uses semantic versioning. However, As of April 29, 2022, `macos_ui` is still
in beta. As such, we are only incrementing the `minor` and `revision` placements (`0.X.0` and `0.0.X`, respectively). Once `macos_ui`
reaches version `1.0`, we will start incrementing the major revision placement.
